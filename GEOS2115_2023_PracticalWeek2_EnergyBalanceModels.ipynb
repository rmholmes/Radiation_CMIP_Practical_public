In these practicals, covering weeks 1-4 of the course, we will be using the python programming language to do some data analysis within a Jupyter-notebook (this file). We will learn some basics of Jupyter-notebooks and python run on the edstem.org platform. \n",

    "Here, we consider the *ice-albedo* feedback. This refers to the fact that as the Earth's surface temperature warms, we expect the ice and snow covering the polar (and mountaneous) regions to melt. As this ice melts, it exposes typically darker, less reflective underlying surfaces such as the ocean or rock. These surfaces have a smaller albedo and thus the planet's albedo overall decreases, causing more solar radiation to be absorbed, warming the planet, further melting the ice and snow which then further reduces the albedo.\n",

    "2. When there is no ice, the albedo is low and so when the surface temperature is greater than 298K (25C) we set the albedo to 0.291.\n",
